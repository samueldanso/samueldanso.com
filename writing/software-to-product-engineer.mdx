# The Evolution: From Software Engineer to Product Engineer

I've been thinking a lot about how my role as an engineer is changing. If you look at my portfolio, you'll notice something: I'm not just shipping features—I'm building products. And that shift wasn't accidental.

## The Bottleneck Has Moved

For years, the constraint in software development was implementation. Could you write the code? Did you know the right frameworks? Could you debug that gnarly memory leak? Those skills mattered because they were the limiting factor.

But something fundamental has shifted.

With LLMs like Claude, ChatGPT, and Copilot, writing code has become easier than ever. I can scaffold entire components, generate type-safe APIs, and even refactor legacy code in minutes. The tools have gotten so good that **implementation is no longer the bottleneck**.

So what is?

**Deciding what to build. And how it should work.**

## The Real Questions Now

The hard questions today aren't about syntax or architecture patterns. They're about:

- What problem are we actually solving?
- Who is this feature for, and what do they need?
- How should this flow feel to a user?
- What's the simplest version that delivers value?
- Should we even build this at all?

These are product questions. Design questions. Questions that require you to think like a user, not just like a developer.

And here's the thing: **AI can't answer these questions for you**. Not yet, anyway. You can't prompt your way to good product intuition. You have to develop it.

## Why I'm Learning Design and Product

This realization is why I've been spending more time learning design and product skills. Not because I want to become a designer or a PM—but because **being great at engineering now means being great at product thinking**.

I've been:
- Studying interaction design and UX patterns
- Learning Figma to prototype ideas before writing code
- Talking to users to understand their pain points
- Reading about product strategy and prioritization
- Thinking deeply about the "why" before jumping to the "how"

It's made me a better engineer. Not because I write better code (though that helps), but because I build better things.

## Product Engineers: The New Frontier

I think we're seeing the emergence of a new breed of engineer: **the Product Engineer**.

Product Engineers aren't just backend devs who can write SQL, or frontend devs who know React. They're engineers who:

- **Understand the full stack** (yes, that part hasn't changed)
- **Think like designers** about UX and interactions
- **Think like PMs** about value and priorities
- **Leverage AI** to move faster on implementation
- **Focus on outcomes**, not just outputs

This isn't a formal role yet (though some companies are starting to use the title). But it's the direction things are moving. And if you look at the most impactful engineers today, they're already operating this way.

## What This Means for You

If you're an engineer, this might feel uncomfortable. Learning design? Talking to users? Thinking about business outcomes? That wasn't in the job description.

But here's my take: **this is an opportunity, not a threat**.

The engineers who adapt—who learn to shape products, not just ship features—will be the most valuable and impactful people in the room. They'll be the ones deciding what gets built, not just building what they're told.

And in an AI-powered world where code gets commoditized, that's exactly where you want to be.

## My 2 Cents

Look, I'm not saying everyone needs to become a product manager. And I'm definitely not saying engineering skills don't matter anymore—they absolutely do. You still need to write clean code, understand systems, and debug production issues.

But the role is evolving. And if you want to stay relevant (and frankly, stay excited about the work), you need to evolve with it.

For me, that means building products that solve real problems. It means caring about the user experience as much as the code quality. It means asking "should we?" before asking "how?"

And honestly? It's made the work way more interesting.
