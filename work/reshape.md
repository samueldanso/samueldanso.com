overview: "Reshape is an AI-powered NFT platform where artists, collectors, and vibe creators can generate, mint, and curate art into unique galleries with the help of a Curator Agent. By combining generative AI with NFTs on Shape L2, it unlocks new creative possibilities while giving collectors verifiable ownership of one-of-a-kind vibes. Reshape is about giving power back to creators and collectors. With AI as a co-creator and Shape as the foundation, anyone can reshape vibes into art, curate them beautifully, and share them with others."
