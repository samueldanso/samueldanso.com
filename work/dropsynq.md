overview: "A SocialFi music platform where artists launch tokenized songs as tradable coins and earn directly from fans. It lets fans discover, trade, support rising talent, and share in the upside — creating a new way to connect and grow through music. Built on Zora. Artists struggle to monetize directly — traditional streaming platforms take large cuts and offer little control or ownership. Fans have no direct way to invest in or own the music they love, or share in artists' success — they're just passive listeners. DropSynq enables artists to mint their songs as tokenized music coins on Zora, unlocking direct-to-fan monetization. Fans can discover, buy, trade, and collect songs as assets — creating a new music economy where both artists and fans benefit."
